<p>This post explains how to make a bubble map with ggplot2.</p>
<p>A bubble map is like a bubble chart, but with a map in the
background. As input you need:</p>
<p>a list of GPS coordinates (longitude and latitude of the places you
want to represent) a numeric variable used for bubble color and size
This post provides a step-by-step approach to build the map beside,
showing the 1000 biggest cities of the UK.</p>
<div id="load-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Load data</h1>
<p>The first step is to get the boundaries of the zone that interests
you. Several option are available in R, as extensively described in the
background map section of the gallery.</p>
<p>Briefly, you can find this information somewhere under the shapefile
format or under the geoJSON format. You can also load google like
backgrounds with the ggmap library.</p>
<p>This post uses the last approach: it loads the maps package that
provides the boundaries of every world country.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
 
# Get the world polygon and extract UK
library(maps)
UK &lt;- map_data(&quot;world&quot;) %&gt;% filter(region==&quot;UK&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The second step is to load a data frame with the info of the bubble
you want to draw. The maps library provides a list of the biggest cities
in the world. Let’s use it to get information on the UK.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Get a data frame with longitude, latitude, and size of bubbles (a bubble = a city)
data &lt;- world.cities %&gt;% filter(country.etc==&quot;UK&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="basic-scatterplot-map" class="section level1">
<h1>Basic scatterplot map</h1>
<p>ggplot2 makes it a breeze to map both information on the same graph.
Use geom_polygon for the shape of UK first, and add your scatterplot on
it with geom_point().</p>
<p>On the right figure, note the use of the ggrepel library to avoid
overlapping between city names.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Left chart

  geom_polygon(data = UK, aes(x=long, y = lat, group = group), fill=&quot;grey&quot;, alpha=0.3) +

# Basic bubble map Now we want to add another information. The number of
inhabitant per city will be mapped to the colour and the size of the
bubbles. Note that the order of city matters! It is advised to show the
most important information on top (center). This can been done sorting
your dataset before making the plot.</p>

breaks.</p>
